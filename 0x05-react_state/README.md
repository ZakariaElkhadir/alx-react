# React State Project

## Overview
This project focuses on adding state management to a React application. The main objectives are:

1. Implementing local state to handle the display of the notifications panel.
2. Creating controlled components and state callbacks in the Login component.
3. Introducing React Context to manage the application's state.
4. Utilizing React Hooks to refactor the CourseListRow component.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of local state and how to manage it in a React component.
- Understand the purpose of controlled components and how to implement them.
- Describe the React Context API and how to use it to manage global state.
- Demonstrate the usage of React Hooks to simplify component logic.

## Requirements
- Implement the tasks in the provided code structure.
- Write tests for the modified components.
- Ensure the application functions as expected after each task.

## Tasks

1. **Adding a local state for notifications**:
   - Modify the `App` component to include a local state for the `displayDrawer` element.
   - Update the `Notifications` component and its test suite accordingly.

2. **Controlled components and state callback**:
   - Create a form within the `Login` component and handle the login submission.
   - Implement controlled components and state callbacks in the `Login` component.
   - Add tests for the modified `Login` component.

3. **Context**:
   - Create a simple React Context in `AppContext.js`.
   - Manage the application's state, including login and logout functions, in the `App` container.
   - Utilize the Context in the `Header` component and add tests.

4. **Introduction to React Hooks**:
   - Refactor the `CourseListRow` component using React Hooks.

## Tips
- Refer to the provided code structure and instructions for each task.
- Write tests for the modified components to ensure the application's functionality.
- Consult the project requirements and guidelines for additional details.
